        <h2>How to Make Jag (Cape Verde Rice)</h2>
            <p>This Cape Verde side called Jagacida is just known as "Jag". There are numerous forms of this dish so you can get as inventive as you would like. Depending on the number of things you that add, it could undoubtedly be a great lunch also. I love the Linguica sausage. Serve this Cape Verde jagacida with some octopus stew and a basic green plate of mixed greens for a true and delectable Cape Verde dinner.</p>
            <p>Did you know that Cape Verde is also called Cabo Verde and is an island off the coast of  West Africa?  When the island was discovered and colonized by the Portuguese in the 15th century, it was uninhabited.  The island became a trading center for African slaves which was abolished in 1876. Today it has one of the most stable governments in Africa.</p>
